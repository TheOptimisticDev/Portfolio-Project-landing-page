            <h1>Website features</h1>
            <p>This website consists of a parallax scrolling effect, built using HTML5 and CSS3 and Javascript. It features a logo which i designed using Canva app, the spider symbolises a web builder and the letters below are my initials followed by my tag line. This is a portfolio project built as a requirement by <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/"><b>ALX Africa</b></a> and <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/"><b>Holberton School.</b></a>
               <br><br>The main features to this portfolio project are the navigation buttons, background color, the clouds, and the sun. The navigation buttons also presents exciting information namely the About button, a blog post, an email contact option and projects button which showcases some of the apps i have built, also available on my Github. The portfolio project source code available <a href="https://github.com/OptimisticUnderdog/Parallax-Portfolio-Project"><b>here.</b></a>

            <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>The buttons presents a hovering effect which changes background color when hovering the mouse pointer. Also consists of a short summary about my self explaining my learning journey.
                <br>The clouds presents a motion to the right side when scrolling down, and move backwards when scrolling upwards, but stagnant if there is no scrolling.
                <br><br>The sun makes a sun-set motion when down paging, likewise it makes a sunrise effect when scrolling up. The 'Explore' button leads to my <a href="https://github.com/OptimisticUnderdog"><b>Github</b></a> account, where every espect of my learning at ALX can be viewed and also explore some of my personal projects. 
                <br><br>In a nutshell the web-app consists of a parallax scrolling effect by simmulating a sunset motion down the mountain when scrolling to a darker theme of the page which showcases some of the top skills i have learnt at ALX Africa while studying Software Engineering.
